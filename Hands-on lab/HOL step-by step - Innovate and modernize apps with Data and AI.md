# Innovate and modernize apps with Data and AI hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on-lab, you will build a cloud processing and machine learning solution for IoT data. We will begin by deploying a factory load simulator using Azure IoT Edge to write into Azure IoT Hub, following the recommendations in the [Azure IoT reference architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot).  The data in this simulator represents sensor data collected from a stamping press machine, which cuts, shapes, and imprints sheet metal.  The rest of the lab will show how to implement an event sourcing architecture using Azure technologies ranging from Cosmos DB to Stream Analytics to Azure Functions to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

Using factory-generated data, you will learn how to use the Anomaly Detection service built into Stream Analytics to observe and report on abnormal machine temperature readings.  You will also learn how to apply historical machine temperature and stamping pressure values in the creation of a machine learning model to identify potential issues which might require machine adjustment.  You will deploy this predictive maintenance model and generate predictions on simulated stamp press data.

## Overview

The Innovate and modernize apps with Data and AI hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using the supplied example that is based on Azure IoT Hub and other related Azure services. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

![High-level architecture, as described below.](media/architecture-diagram.png "High-level architecture")

The solution begins with multiple IoT devices, located within multiple factories, that securely connect to Azure IoT Hub to send telemetry. IoT Hub provides IoT device management, telemetry ingest at high volume, and the ability to send commands to devices as needed. IoT Edge allows individual manufacturing machines to interact with IoT Hub by sending telemetry messages to IoT Hub and by ensuring that edge devices are running the latest versions of deployed modules. Telemetry from IoT Hub automatically triggers an Azure function, which processes the events, assigns a unique `entity_id`, and stores them in an Azure Cosmos DB telemetry container. The document TTL (time-to-live) is set to 30 days, after which time they will automatically expire. The data is replicated long-term to the analytical store with no TTL. The analytical store saves all transactional data in columnar storage in a cost-effective way, automatically, with no ETL required.

![Data is pushed into IoT Hub, and then an Azure Function processes that data and writes it to Cosmos DB.](media/architecture-diagram-1.png "From IoT to Cosmos DB")

A different Azure function implements event sourcing by triggering off the Azure Cosmos DB change feed for additional processing, including predictive maintenance scoring via a custom-trained Machine Learning model deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for real-time scoring.

![Another Azure Function performs telemetry scoring.](media/architecture-diagram-2.png "Predictive maintenance scoring")

The function sends the scored data to an Azure Event Hub. Another function that consumes the change feed and saves the event data to domain entities, including state data. This database stores all sensor data as domain entities, partitioned by device Id, which the Hyperscale features uses to automatically shard the data for horizontal scaling and high performance reads and writes. An Azure Stream Analytics job reads the device telemetry, which includes the predictive maintenance prediction, and applies additional processing through a SQL-like query language. It uses an Azure Cognitive Services Anomaly Detector service to perform Changepoint and Spike-and-Dip anomaly detection. It also performs windowed aggregate queries against the time series data to create aggregates on machine maintenance predictions, grouped by maintenance requirement, factory, and machine. The temperature anomalies, telemetry with predictive maintenance scores, and temperature anomaly data is saved to another Azure Cosmos DB container, named `scored_telemetry`. Another Azure function implements event sourcing by triggering off the Azure Cosmos DB change feed from the `scored_telemetry` container. It saves the anomaly detection, windowed aggregates, and scored predictive maintenance event data to domain entities, including state data, and writes them to Cosmos DB.

![The Function writes to Event Hub, were data is aggregated and anomaly detection occurs.  The results then are written to Cosmos DB.](media/architecture-diagram-3.png "Anomaly detection and writing to scored data")

An Azure Synapse Analytics workspace securely connects to Azure Cosmos DB through a linked service and uses the Synapse Link feature to access both the transactional store (OLTP) and analytical store (OLAP) of each Azure Cosmos DB container. The analytical store is optimized for read-heavy queries, which do not consume Azure Cosmos DB resource units (RUs), as opposed to reading the transactional store. All raw historical event data is accessible through the analytical store, which serves as the data lake, but with no ETL requirements. Synapse Spark notebooks read the analytical store to perform Machine Learning model training and deployments through Azure Machine Learning, data exploration, and batch scoring. Synapse pipelines are used for batch processing at scale over data fed into the analytical store from IoT devices originating from all factories. Wide World Importers data analysts use the Power BI integration capabilities of Synapse Analytics to create reports against Synapse Serverless views that display data from the analytical stores, as well as data stored in the SQL Pools. These reports are also embedded in the web application, making them available to end-users who do not have access to the Synapse Analytics workspace or Power BI online.

![Cosmos DB integrates with Azure Synpase Analytics via Synapse Link.](media/architecture-diagram-4.png "Azure Synapse Analytics interactions with Cosmos DB")

The web app is a modernized version of WWI's old monolithic web app, implementing a microservices pattern through Docker containers deployed to Azure. The CQRS pattern is applied by separating create, update, and delete (CUD) commands from query (read) commands, issued by microservices deployed to different containers. The metadata command microservice, for example, issues CUD commands to the `metadata` Azure Cosmos DB container. Factory, machine, maintenance criteria, and other metadata are stored in this container. A query microservice issues read requests to read microservices for telemetry and metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

    ```python
    from azureml.core import Workspace, Environment, Datastore
    from azureml.core.experiment import Experiment
    from azureml.core.run import Run
    from azureml.core.model import Model

    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    import joblib
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    ws = Workspace.from_config()

    # Load data
    ds = Datastore.get(ws, "modernizeappstorage")
    ds.download(".", prefix="maintenancedata/HistoricalMaintenanceRecord.csv")
    f = open("maintenancedata/HistoricalMaintenanceRecord.csv")
    data = np.loadtxt(f, delimiter=",")
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=data, columns=['Pressure','MachineTemperature','Label'])
    X = df[['Pressure','MachineTemperature']]
    y = df[['Label']]
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)

    # Begin experiment
    experiment = Experiment(workspace=ws, name="Stamp_Press_Experiment")
    run = experiment.start_logging()

    # Fit the data to a decision tree
    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Try the model on the hold-out data set and print accuracy.
    y_predict = clf.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_predict)

    # Log the accuracy
    run.log('Accuracy', accuracy)

    print()
    print('#############################')
    print('Accuracy is {}'.format(accuracy))
    print('#############################')
    print()

    # Save the model and upload it to the run
    model_file_name = 'outputs/model.pkl'
    joblib.dump(value = clf, filename = model_file_name)

    # Typically, the run.upload_file() method would be used to capture saved files
    # However, as per the Azure documentation, files stored in the outputs/ directory are automatically captured by the current Run

    # Complete the run
    run.complete()

    # Register the model with the workspace
    model = run.register_model(model_name = 'stamp_press_model', model_path = model_file_name)
    ```

    This notebook pulls the maintenance record history from `HistoricalMaintenanceRecord.csv` and builds a Pandas DataFrame from it.  We then break out data into two DataFrames, `X` and `y`.  The `y` DataFrame contains the column `Label`, which is what we want to predict.  We use the `X` values of `Pressure` and `MachineTemperature` to make the best prediction of `Label` that we can.  Then, we break out data into training and test datasets and fit the training data to a decision tree (essentially, a series of if-else statements).  To gauge the quality of our simple model, we generate predictions against the test data set and compare those predicted scores to the actual values and print out the overall accuracy of the model.  After doing this, we serialize the model as a Pickle file and register this new model as `stamp_press_model`.

6. After the **Compute** has been created, select **Run cell** on the cell. This will train and test a predictive maintenance model and then register the final model with Azure ML.

    ![Running code to train an Azure ML model.](media/azure-ml-notebook-run.png 'Run cell')

    You may receive a prompt to sign in. If you do, copy the code in your notebook and then select the link to authenticate.

    ![A prompt to perform interactive authentication.](media/azure-ml-notebook-authentication.png 'Performing interactive authentication')

    After selecting the link, enter the code and select **Next**. You may be prompted to select an account; if so, choose your Azure account and continue.

    ![A prompt to enter the authentication code.](media/azure-ml-notebook-authentication-2.png 'Enter code')

    Once you have authenticated, the code will run and return a result for accuracy. This result should be approximately 94-95%.

### Task 4: Deploy the predictive maintenance model

1. Navigate to the **Models** section and then select **stamp_press_model**.

    ![The stamp_press_model is selected.](media/azure-ml-models.png 'stamp_press_model')

2. On the model's page, select **Deploy** to deploy the model and then select **Deploy to web service**.

    ![The deploy to web service option is selected.](media/azure-ml-model-deploy.png 'Deploy')

    >**Note**: in a production scenario, you will likely wish to use [Azure Machine Learning's MLOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/mlops/) instead of deploying models by hand through Azure ML Studio.

3. In the **Deploy a model** section, complete the following and then select **Deploy**. The **Entry script file** and **Conda dependencies file** are located in the folder containing hands-on lab resources, in the **Resources\Azure ML** directory.

   | Field                          | Value                                              |

   ![The model deployment settings are selected.](media/azure-ml-model-deploy-2.png 'Deploy a model')

4. Navigate to **Endpoints** and select the **stamp-press-model** endpoint.

    ![The stamp press model is selected.](media/azure-ml-endpoints.png 'Endpoints')

5. In the stamp-press-model endpoint, observe the current state. If the Deployment state is **Transitioning** or **Unhealthy**, this means that Azure Machine Learning is still deploying the endpoint. Once the deployment state switches to **Healthy**, deployment succeeded, and your Azure Machine Learning deployment is ready to be consumed.  It may take **up to 10 minutes** before the Deployment state is Healthy.

    ![The stamp press model is deployed.](media/azure-ml-deployed.png 'Deployed model')

    If, after 10 minutes, you still do not have a **Healthy** deployment state, you can [troubleshoot the process locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-local), on a machine which has Python, the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK, and the Azure CLI installed.  Open a command prompt and navigate to the **Resources\Azure ML** folder.  Then, use the following code to deploy a container locally.  You will need to fill in your Azure Machine Learning workspace name and subscription ID.

    ```python
    from azureml.core.webservice import Webservice
    from azureml.core.model import InferenceConfig
    from azureml.core.environment import Environment
    from azureml.core import Workspace
    from azureml.core.model import Model

    ws = Workspace.get(name="<AML workspace name>", subscription_id="<subscription ID>", resource_group="modernize-app")
    model = Model(ws, 'stamp_press_model')


    myenv = Environment.from_conda_specification(name="env", file_path="env.yml")
    inference_config = InferenceConfig(entry_script="score.py", environment=myenv)
    deployment_config = LocalWebservice.deploy_configuration(port=6789)

    local_service = Model.deploy(workspace=ws, 
                        name='stamp-press-local', 
                        models=[model], 
                        inference_config=inference_config, 
                        deployment_config = deployment_config)

    local_service.wait_for_deployment(show_output=True)
    print(f"Scoring URI is : {local_service.scoring_uri}")
    ```

    Wait until the container is running and execute `docker ps -a` to get the container ID.  Then, run `docker logs <container ID>` to troubleshoot the problem.

### Task 5: Test the predictive maintenance model

1. While viewing the **stamp-press-model** endpoint details, copy the **REST endpoint** value to a text editor.

2. Open a command prompt and run the following command, replacing `{YOUR CONTAINER LOCATION}` with the URI of your Azure Container Instance.

    ```cmd
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"data\": [{\"Pressure\":7470, \"MachineTemperature\":69}, {\"Pressure\":7490, \"MachineTemperature\":55}, {\"Pressure\":7800, \"MachineTemperature\":30}]}" http://{YOUR CONTAINER LOCATION}/score
    ```

    You should receive back a JSON array with the values `[1.0,0.0,3.0]`.

    >**Note**: If you do not have the curl application installed, you may alternatively wish to install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), a free tool for making web requests.

3. Try modifying the input JSON and seeing what results you get. The following table represents the true maintenance requirements.

   | Pressure | Machine Temperature | ID | Maintenance Required  |
   | -------- | ------------------- | -- | -------------------------- |
   | < 7475   | < 70                | 1  | Tighten adjustment harness |
   | > 7600   | 50 <= x < 70        | 2  | Loosen adjustment harness  |
   | > 7600   | < 50                | 3  | Tighten restrictor plate   |
   | < 7475   | >= 70               | 4  | Loosen restrictor plate    |
   | > 7600   | >= 70               | 5  | Replace fabrication screws |
   | 7475 <= x <= 7600    | 50 <= x <= 70   | 0  | No maintenance required    |

    Like any realistic data set, the historical maintenance record is imperfect and so the data your model trained on will include some incorrect maintenance operations, leading to incorrect maintenance recommendations. Try a few values near the edges of pressure and machine temperature to see.

## Exercise 3:  Create an Azure Function to send event telemetry to Cosmos DB

Duration: 30 minutes

[Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/) is a Microsoft offering which provides secure and reliable communication between IoT devices and cloud services in Azure. The aim of this service is to provide bidirectional communication at scale. The core focus of many industrial companies is not on cloud computing; therefore, they do not necessarily have the personnel skilled to provide guidance and to stand up a reliable and scalable infrastructure for an IoT solution. It is imperative for these types of companies to enter the IoT space not only for the cost savings associated with remote monitoring, but also to improve safety for their workers and the environment.

Wide World Importers is one such company that could use a helping hand entering the IoT space.  They have an existing suite of sensors and on-premises data collection mechanisms at each factory but would like to centralize data in the cloud. To achieve this, we will stand up a IoT Hub and assist them with the process of integrating existing sensors with IoT Hub via [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-edge/). A [predictable cost model](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub/) also ensures that there are no financial surprises.

For this lab, we will simulate the IoT process using an Azure Function. In this exercise, we will create the Azure Function to generate event data and connect it to Cosmos DB for downstream enrichment.

    ```

    For an explanation of the code, we will build messages in the shape of `MessageBody`, which includes a `Machine` entry containing information about the monitored machine, as well as an `Ambient` entry which contains the current temperature and humidity in the room.  The `GenerateNewMessage()` function builds artificial messages which generally follow a normal distribution but occasionally exhibit anomalous behavior.  After generating a message, we serialize the message and convert into a `TelemetryOutput` object.  This wrapper includes several attributes which we will use to track data as it changes through the course of data processing.

13. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, enter the following commands.

    ```cmd
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos
    dotnet restore
    dotnet build
    ```

    After running these commands, you should receive a message that the build succeeded.

    ![The Azure Function built successfully.](media/code-function-build-succeeded.png 'Build succeeded.')

    > **Note**:  If you get warnings which read like "Could not evaluate 'Cosmos.CRTCompat.dll' for extension metadata" that this is fine. It has to do with missing debugger symbols on the Cosmos DB NuGet packages and will not affect deployment or the lab.  As long as you see that the build succeeded with 0 errors, it should be fine.

### Task 4: Deploy and configure an Azure Function

1. In Visual Studio Code, select the **Azure** menu option and navigate to **Functions**. Drill down into **Local Project** to **Functions** until you see the **WriteEventsToTelemetryContainer** function.

    ![The Azure Function.](media/code-function-telemetry-view.png 'WriteEventsToTelemetryContainer')

2. Select the **WriteEventsToTelemetryContainer** function and then select the **Deploy to Function App...** operation. You may need to move the mouse to the top-right corner of the Functions tab to view this option.

    ![Deploy to Function App is selected.](media/code-function-telemetry-deploy.png 'Deploy to Function App...')

3. Choose the appropriate subscription from the list. Then, choose the Function App named **modernize-app-#SUFFIX#** from the Function App list.

    ![The appropriate Function App is selected.](media/code-function-deploy-app.png 'Select Function App in Azure')

4. Select **Deploy** in the ensuing modal dialog.

    ![The option to deploy is selected.](media/code-function-deploy-check.png 'Deploy')

5. After deployment completes, navigate to the **modernize-app** resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Then, select the **modernize-app** entry with a Type of **Function App**.

    ![The modernize-app Function App is selected.](media/azure-function-select.png 'modernize-app')

6. In the Settings menu, select **Configuration**. Then, select **Application settings** and then **+ New application setting**.

    ![The New application setting is selected.](media/azure-function-new-appsetting.png 'New Application setting')

7. Add the following application settings. For each one, select **OK** to save the setting and then **+ New application setting** to add the next. Be sure to replace any references to things such as **#SUFFIX**, **{PRIMARY KEY}**, or **{your_password}** with the appropriate values.

   | Name                           | Value                                              |
   | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------         |
   | cosmosEndpointUrl              | _enter the Cosmos DB URL, something like `https://modernize-app-#SUFFIX#.documents.azure.com:443/`_ |
   | cosmosPrimaryKey               | _enter the primary key for your Cosmos DB account_ |
   | azureMLEndpointUrl             | _enter the URL (with /score) from exercise 3_      |
   | modernizeapp\_COSMOSDB         | _`AccountEndpoint=https://modernize-app-#SUFFIX#.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey={PRIMARY KEY};`_ |
   | EventHubConnection             | _enter the Event Hub primary connection string_    |

8. Select **Save** and then **Continue** on the App Service menu to save the new application settings.  These application settings will be used in the Azure functions we have created.  `cosmosEndpointUrl` and `cosmosPrimaryKey` will be used in the `WriteEventsToTelemetryContainer` function.  `azureMLEndpointUrl` and `EventHubConnection` will be used in the `ProcessTelemetryEvents` function.  Finally, `modernizeapp_COSMOSDB` will be used in the `ProcessTemperatureAnomalyEvents` and `ProcessTelemetryEvents` functions.  By creating these application settings, we avoid the risk of hard-coding connection strings in our files or including passwords in configuration files which might be checked into source control.  The application settings are stored securely and if you have multiple environments, you can configure each App Service to use different settings.

    ![The New application settings are filled out.](media/azure-function-new-appsettings.png 'New application settings')

9. Return to the **Overview** menu and then **Stop** and **Start** the Azure Function. This will allow the function to pick up your new application settings and begin publishing data to Cosmos DB.

## Exercise 4:  Enrich event telemetry with predictive maintenance results

Duration: 30 minutes

Events are loading into the `telemetry` container. Using that data, we can create a function which handles and enriches the telemetry data. In this exercise, you will create a function which reads telemetry data from Cosmos DB, then enriches the data with results from your predictive maintenance model and writes the results to an Event Hub.

### Task 1:  Create an Event Hub

1. Navigate to the **modernize-app** resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    ![The resource group named modernize-app is selected.](media/azure-modernize-app-rg.png 'The modernize-app resource group')

    If you do not see the resource group in the Recent resources section, type in "resource groups" in the top search menu and then select **Resource groups** from the results.

    ![In the Services search result list, Resource groups is selected.](media/azure-resource-group-search.png 'Resource groups')

    From there, select the **modernize-app** resource group.

2. Navigate to the **modernize-app-#SUFFIX** entry with a Type of **Event Hubs Namespace**.

    ![In the modernize-app resource group, the Event Hubs Namespace is selected.](media/azure-event-hubs-namespace.png 'Event Hubs Namespace')

3. In the Event Hubs Namespace, select **Event Hubs** from the Entities menu. Then select **+ Event Hub** to add a new Event Hub.

    ![Add an Event Hub is selected.](media/azure-event-hub-create.png 'New Event Hub')

4. Give the new event hub a name of `telemetry_to_score` and then select **Create**.

    ![The event hub details are filled in.](media/azure-create-event-hub-1.png 'Create Event Hub')

5. Select the new **telemetry_to_score** event hub. Then, select **Consumer groups** in the Entities menu and select  **+ Consumer group** to add a new consumer group.

    ![Add a consumer group is selected.](media/azure-event-hub-consumer-group.png 'New Consumer group')

6. Give the consumer group a name of `anomalydetection` and select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create an Azure Function based on a Cosmos DB trigger

1. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the folder you created in Exercise 4 for Azure Functions. In the Azure menu, navigate to the top-right corner and select **Create Function...**

    ![Create Function is selected.](media/code-create-function.png 'Create Function')

2. Fill in the following for each step of the function creation wizard.

   | Step                             | Value                                              |
   | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------         |
   | Template                         | _select `Azure Cosmos DB trigger`_                 |

   | Collection name                  | _`telemetry`_                                      |

   ![The correct template is selected, indicating the first step in the process.](media/code-cosmosdb-trigger.png 'Cosmos DB Trigger')

3. Open **local.settings.json** and add entries for the following, replacing references such as **modernize-app-#SUFFIX**, server names, or **{your_password}** with appropriate values.

    ```json
    "azureMLEndpointUrl": "{ Your Azure ML endpoint with /score }",
    "EventHubConnection": "{ Your Event Hub primary connection string }"
    ```

    >**Note**: Use the Event Hub connection string you saved before the lab.

    ![The new local settings are filled in.](media/azure-function-local-settings.png 'local.settings.json')

4. In the **ProcessTelemetryEvents.cs** file, replace the existing code with the following.

            }

    }
    ```

    The code in this function collects data from a specified Cosmos DB collection and writes it to an Event Hub.  The `Run()` method triggers every time a new entry is added to the Cosmos DB collection `sensors.telemetry`.  There can be more than one document per `Run()` call, so we need to process each one individually.  We first convert the Cosmos telemetry record into a `TelemetryOutput` and deserialize the event's `MessageBody`.

    The next step is to call the Azure Machine Learning endpoint for the stamp press model.  This requires the machine temperature and pressure, which we can collect from the message.  We then call `GetMaintenancePrediction()` to make the HTTP request.  Azure Machine Learning returns a list of predictions, but because we only sent one item's inputs, we expect to get only one result.

    Once we have the maintenance prediction, we can write a new `TelemetryOutput` message which contains the prediction to an Event Hub.

5. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, enter the following commands.

    ```cmd
    dotnet add package Azure.Messaging.EventHubs
    dotnet restore
    dotnet build
    ```

    After running these commands, you should receive a message that the build succeeded.

    WHERE
        CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipResult, 'IsAnomaly') AS bigint) = 1
        AND CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipResult, 'Score') AS float)  < 0.001;
    ```

    In the `RawData` common table expression, we parse the event data JSON to obtain the machine temperature.  We can use that temperature in the `AnomalyDetectionStep` common table expression to perform spike and dip analysis of temperature for anomalies.  We want to analyze temperature with a confidence of 80% or better and looking back at the last 60 data points over a five-minute period.  In the main query, we write data if Azure Cognitive Services deems a given result as anomalous and if its score is sufficiently low that we expect it not to be a false positive. These anomalous results will be written into Cosmos DB for later processing.

14. Select **Test query** to ensure that the queries run. You will see only the results of the last query in the Test results window and only the inputs and outputs you created in the Inputs and Outputs sections, respectively. If you want to see the results of a different query, highlight that query and select **Test selected query**.

    ![Testing the queries in stream analytics.](media/azure-stream-analytics-test-query.png 'Test query')

15. Once you are satisfied with query results, select **Save query** to save your changes.

16. Return to the **Overview** page and select **Start** to begin processing. In the subsequent menu, select **Start** once more. It may take approximately 1-2 minutes for the Stream Analytics job to start.

    ![The Start option in the Overview page is selected.](media/azure-stream-analytics-start.png 'Start')

## Exercise 6: Modernize services logic to use event sourcing and CQRS

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise you will deploy a group of microservices that use the CQRS pattern to read and write your data through a web application.

### Task 1: Build and push the containers

1. In PowerShell, change your directory to `Hands-on lab\Resources\Microservices`.

2. Navigate to the Terminal and enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    docker login -u <USERNAME> -p "<PASSWORD>" <CONTAINER_REGISTRY>
    ```

    Enter appropriate values for username, password, and container registry URL.  You can find these on the **Access keys** menu of the Container registry you have created.

    ![Log in to the Azure Container Repository account.](media/microservices-login.png 'Docker login')

3. Run the following commands to build the docker containers, substituting the name of the container registry you created before the Hands-on Lab:

    ```powershell
    docker build -f .\SynapseInnovateMcwWebapp\Dockerfile -t <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-webapp .
    docker build -f .\QueryService\Dockerfile             -t <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-query-service .
    docker build -f .\MachineTelemetryRead\Dockerfile     -t <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-machine-telemetry-read .
    docker build -f .\MetadataRead\Dockerfile             -t <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-metadata-read .
    docker build -f .\MetadataWrite\Dockerfile            -t <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-metadata-write .
    ```

    > **Note**:  If you receive an error when trying to build the `synapse-innovate-mcw-webapp` package reading "ERROR [internal] load build context" the reason is that the file path is too long for Windows to build the container image.  Move the `Microservices` folder to be the root directory on your drive and run the build process again.

4. Run the following commands to push the containers to your container registry:

    ```powershell
    docker push <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-webapp
    docker push <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-query-service
    docker push <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-machine-telemetry-read
    docker push <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-metadata-read
    docker push <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/microservices/synapse-innovate-mcw-metadata-write
    ```

### Task 2: Create a deployment file

1. In the `Hands-on lab\Resources\Microservices` directory create a new file named `deploy-aci.yaml`.

2. Paste in the file contents below, making sure to replace the text in angle brackets with the appropriate values:

    ```

3. You can navigate to the IP address in the table to visit the web app.

## Exercise 7: View the factory status in a Power BI report

Duration: 30 minutes

In this final exercise, you will load data from Cosmos DB containers into an Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Pool, create visualizations in Power BI, and embed your Power BI report into your event-driven website.

### Task 1: Import events data via a Spark notebook

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), type in "azure synapse analytics" in the top search menu and then select **Azure Synapse Analytics (workspaces preview)** from the results.

    ![In the Services search result list, Azure Synapse Analytics (workspaces preview) is selected.](media/azure-create-synapse-search.png 'Azure Synapse Analytics (workspaces preview)')

2. Select the workspace you created before the hands-on lab.

    ![The Azure Synapse Analytics workspace for the lab is selected.](media/azure-synapse-select.png 'modernizeapp workspace')

3. Select **Open Synapse Studio** from the Synapse workspace page.

    ![Open Synapse Studio is selected.](media/azure-synapse-launch-studio.png 'Open Synapse Studio')

4. In the **Manage** page, select **Linked services** from the External connections section. Then select **+ New**.

    ![The New option is selected for linked services.](media/azure-synapse-manage-linked-services.png 'New linked service')

5. In the search box, type in "cosmos" and select **Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API)**. Then select **Continue**.

    ![The Azure Cosmos DB SQL API linked service is selected.](media/azure-synapse-cosmos-linked-service.png 'Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API) linked service')

6. In the **New linked service** window, complete the following:

   | Field                          | Value                                              |
   | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------         |
   | Name                           | _`modernize_app_cosmos`_                           |
   | Account selection method       | _select `From Azure subscription`_                 |
   | Cosmos  DB account name        | _select the appropriate account_                   |
   | Database name                  | _select `sensors`_                                 |

   ![In the New linked service output, form field entries are filled in.](media/azure-synapse-cosmos-linked-service-2.png 'Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API) linked service form details')

7. Select the **Test connection** option to ensure that your connection will work, and then select **Create** to create the linked service.

8. In the Azure Synapse Workspace, select **Develop**

    ![The Develop option is selected.](media/azure-synapse-workspace-develop.png 'Develop')

9. Select the **+** and then choose **Notebook** from the ensuing dropdown list.

    ![Add a new Notebook.](media/azure-synapse-develop-notebook.png 'Add a new Notebook')

10. In the **Properties** tab, change the **Name** to `Write Cosmos Changes to SQL Pool`.

    ![Rename the Notebook to Write Cosmos Changes to SQL Pool.](media/azure-synapse-develop-cosmos-name.png 'Write Cosmos Changes to SQL Pool')

11. In the notebook toolbar, change the language to **Spark (Scala)**. [The Azure Synapse Apache Spark connector to Synapse SQL connector currently only supports Scala](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/synapse-spark-sql-pool-import-export), so the default language of PySpark will not work.  Also ensure that the notebook is attached to the `modernizeapp` Spark cluster.

    ![Change the notebook language to Scala.](media/azure-synapse-develop-cosmos-language.png 'Spark (Scala)')

12. In the main section, paste in the following code to retrieve data from the `telemetry` container and select only the necessary column, then parse the JSON event data for key measures.

    ```scala
    // Load telemetry data
    import org.apache.spark.sql.functions.{lit, schema_of_json, from_json}
    import collection.JavaConverters._

    val df = spark.read.format("cosmos.olap").
        option("spark.synapse.linkedService", "modernize_app_cosmos").
        option("spark.cosmos.container", "telemetry").
        load().
        select($"event_data")

    val schema = schema_of_json(lit(df.select($"event_data").as[String].first))
    val dfFlat = df.withColumn("event_data", from_json($"event_data", schema, Map[String, String]().asJava)).
        select("event_data.factoryId", "event_data.machine.electricityUtilization",
            "event_data.machine.machineId", "event_data.machine.pressure", "event_data.machine.temperature",
            "event_data.timeCreated")
    dfFlat.show(10)
    ```

    The `df` DataFrame loads data from the `telemetry` container and selects the `event_data` column.  Then, we determine the schema of the `event_data` JSON by parsing the first row.  After figuring out the schema, we flatten the JSON and include several columns.

    Now, run the code block by selecting **Run** (shaped like a play button) or by pressing `Shift+Enter` when inside the notebook cell. After the job completes, you should see a table with the first ten anomalous results, assuming there are at least ten anomalous results by the time you reach this step.

    ![Code to connect to Cosmos DB is entered and ready to run.](media/azure-synapse-develop-cosmos-connect.png 'Connect to Cosmos DB from a notebook')

    >**Note**: it may take several minutes for a Spark session to start. The notebook cell output text will read "Starting Spark session" during this time.

13. Below the first code block, select **+ Code** and add a new code cell. Enter and then run the following code to create a new SQL Pool table with machine anomaly data.

    ```scala
    // Ensure that this table does not already exist on your SQL Pool; otherwise, you will get an error!
    dfFlat.write.synapsesql("modernapp.dbo.MachineTelemetry", Constants.INTERNAL)
    ```

    > **Note**:  you might receive the following error when executing this block.
    >
    > *org.apache.hadoop.fs.azurebfs.contracts.exceptions.AbfsRestOperationException: Operation failed: "This request is not authorized to perform this operation using this permission.", 403, HEAD*.
    >
    > If you do receive this error, it means that you are not the storage blob owner.  To fix this, navigate to the **modappadls#SUFFIX#** storage account and select **Access Control (IAM)** from the **Settings** menu.  Then, add the **Storage Blob Data Owner** role assignment to your user.  Wait a few minutes for this to propagate and you should be able to execute the above script.

14. After the code segment completes, select **+** and add a new cell with the following code to ensure that the SQL pool has loaded correctly.

    ```scala
    val sqldf = spark.read.synapsesql("modernapp.dbo.MachineTelemetry") 
    sqldf.show(10)
    ```

    ![The SQL Pool results are returned.](media/azure-synapse-develop-cosmos-success.png 'Retrieve data from a SQL Pool')

15. Following this same pattern, add a new code cell to load data from the `scored_telemetry` container into the SQL pool, providing data on temperature anomalies.

    ```scala
    val dfs = spark.read.format("cosmos.olap").
        option("spark.synapse.linkedService", "modernize_app_cosmos").
        option("spark.cosmos.container", "scored_telemetry").
        load().
        select($"event_data")

    val schemas = schema_of_json(lit(dfs.select($"event_data").as[String].first))
    val dfFlats = dfs.withColumn("event_data", from_json($"event_data", schema, Map[String, String]().asJava)).
        select("event_data.factoryId", "event_data.machine.electricityUtilization",
            "event_data.machine.machineId", "event_data.machine.pressure", "event_data.machine.temperature",
            "event_data.timeCreated")

    // Ensure that this table does not already exist on your SQL Pool; otherwise, you will get an error!
    dfFlat.write.sqlanalytics("modernapp.dbo.TemperatureAnomaly", Constants.INTERNAL)

    val sqldf = spark.read.sqlanalytics("modernapp.dbo.TemperatureAnomaly") 
    sqldf.show(10)
    ```

18. Return to Azure Synapse Studio and select **Close and refresh** to see the new dataset.

    ![The dataset is loaded and now you can close the wizard and refresh the list of Power BI datasets.](media/power-bi-new-dataset-9.png 'Close and refresh')

19. In the **Power BI reports** menu, select **Modern App Dataset**.

    ![The new Power BI report option is selected.](media/power-bi-new-report-1.png 'New Power BI report')

20. You will now test two conjectures from the manufacturing floor.  The first is that spikes in electricity utilization drive temperature anomalies.  Here, you will perform a simple comparison of average electricity utilization for anomalies versus average overall electricity utilization.  To do so, first, select a card visual from the Power BI Visualizations menu.  In the **TemperatureAnomalies** dataset, select and drag **electricityUtilization** to the **Fields** menu for the card.

    ![The average of electricity utilization for anomalous data is displayed.](media/power-bi-new-report-2.png 'Anomalous electricity utilization')

21. Deselect the card displaying anomalous data by selecting somewhere on the Power BI canvas, and then select the card visual again.  This time, choose the **electricityUtilization** field from the **MachineTelemetry** dataset.  The end result is that temperature anomalies do not seem to correspond with changes in electricity utilization.

    ![The average of electricity utilization was the same for anomalous and non-anomalous data.](media/power-bi-new-report-3.png 'Electricity utilization')

22. The second conjecture from the manufacturing floor is that pressure and machine temperature are independent from one another--that is, warmer or colder temperatures do not affect the amount of stamping pressure measured.  To test this conjecture, deselect the card displaying electricity utilization.  Then, select the scatterplot visual.  Drag **temperature** from **MachineTelemetry** to the X Axis and **pressure** to the Y Axis.  Note that only one data point appears, as these are the *sums* of temperature and pressure, not individual data points.

    ![A scatter plot showing the sum of temperature versus the sum of pressure.](media/power-bi-new-report-4.png 'Temperature versus pressure')

23. In the drop-down menu for temperature, select **Don't summarize** to remove the summarization.  Repeat the process for pressure.

    ![Removing summarization for the temperature and pressure variables.](media/power-bi-new-report-5.png 'Do not summarize')

24. With the summarizations removed, observe that temperature and pressure do not appear to be related:  as temperature increases, pressure behaves the same.

    ![A scatter plot showing the lack of relationship between temperature and pressure.](media/power-bi-new-report-6.png 'Temperature versus pressure')

25. You may add additional visuals.  When you are done, select **Save** to save the changes and make them available.

    ![The Save option is selected.](media/power-bi-new-report-7.png 'Save')

### Task 3: Embed the Power BI notebook

1. In your Power BI report, select the three dots next to the **Favorite** button and select `Embed > Website or portal`.

    ![The menu for embedding the report.](media/embed-website-or-portal.png "Embed on Website or portal")

    If you are using the new Power BI look, navigate to the **File** menu and select **Embed**.

    ![The new look menu for embedding the report.](media/power-bi-embed-file-menu.png "Embed")

2. When the **Secure Embed Code** window pops up, copy the value of the iframe's src attribute.

    >**Note**: You may need to copy the whole iframe html out to a text editor in order to access the src attribute's value.

    ![In the secure embed code window, the source URL is selected.](media/secure-embed-window.png "The Secure embed code")

3. In your `deploy-aci.yaml` file add a new environment variable entry to the **webapp** container, replacing the <EMBED_URL> with the value of the src attribute you just got:

    ```yaml
    - name: POWER_BI_DASHBOARD_URL
      value: <EMBED_URL>
    ```

    ![Adding the new environment variable.](media/yaml-add-power-bi-dashboard.png "Adding a new environment variable")

4. Re-deploy your container group:

    ```powershell
    az container create --resource-group modernize-app --file .\deploy-aci.yaml
    ```

5. If you visit your webapp, your Power BI Dashboard should now be displayed on the home page.
